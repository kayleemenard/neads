Service Dogs for people who are deaf or have hearing loss (2010).

about how Service Dogs can help wounded veterans (2005).

Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans, Service Dogs for Veterans (2006).

Our Service Dogs include both animal shelter rescues and puppies that are donated or sold
to us by breeders. </p>
