    <p class="unit xs-1 s-1 m-1 l-1-3 gutter-1-2">Hearing Dogs are especially sensitive to noises, and a deaf partner can learn a lot about his or her environment just by watching the dog’s visual cues. A dog may notice when someone approaches from behind and tries to get the attention of his or her handler. A Hearing Dog, along with his or her "Hearing Dog" vest, is often the first indicator to the public that the deaf individual may need to be spoken to face-to-face or in another manner.</p> 

    <p class="unit xs-1 s-1 m-1 l-1-3 gutter-1-2">Hearing Dogs communicate with their deaf partners by making physical contact with them and then leading them to the location of the sound. Small dogs will jump up on a person's leg or lap to alert their partner, while large dogs will seek out a person's hand with their nose to make contact.</p> 

    <p class="unit xs-1 s-1 m-1 l-1-3 gutter-1-2">Our Hearing Dogs are both mixed breeds from shelters or rescue groups, and puppies from our puppy program who are better suited to a career as a Hearing Dog.</p>

  <h1 class="unit xs-1 s-1 m-1 l-1">Veterans</h1>

  <div class="grid">
    <p class="unit xs-1 s-1 m-1-2 l-1-4 gutter-1-2">Our Service Dogs for Veterans (formerly Canines for Combat Veterans) program is designed to help the growing population of veterans who could benefit from canine assistance.</p>

    <p class="unit xs-1 s-1 m-1-2 l-1-4 gutter-1-2">In May of 2006, NEADS was invited to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center outside Washington, D.C. to give a presentation about the many skills and tasks that our dogs could offer to combat veterans. NEADS was the first Service Dog organization to be invited to Walter Reed for this purpose. In addition to hospital staff and administrators, many servicemen and women who had served in Iraq or Afghanistan (and were at Walter Reed being treated for injuries) were in attendance at the meeting. Our presentation drew a great deal of interest and enthusiasm.</p>

    <p class="unit xs-1 s-1 m-1-2 l-1-4 gutter-1-2">NEADS immediately recognized that the growing population of wounded veterans required a program that was specially designed to meet their needs, and NEADS formed the Canines for Combat Veterans (CCV) program, which is today known as Service Dogs for Veterans (SDV).</p>

    <p class="unit xs-1 s-1 m-1-2 l-1-4 gutter-1-2">The Service Dogs for Veterans program pairs highly trained NEADS dogs with qualified veterans of our armed services who could benefit from canine assistance. Since 2006, NEADS has placed 96 dogs with veterans at no cost.</p>

  <h1 class="unit xs-1 s-1 m-1 l-1">Physical Disability</h1>

  <img class="unit xs-1 s-1 m-1 l-1 pad-b image-2" src="images/dog-wheelchair3.jpg" alt="Woman and man with physical disability with dogs">

  <div class="grid">
    <p class="unit xs-1 s-1 m-1-2 l-1-2 gutter-1-2">Service Dogs assist people with a physical disability by performing tasks that their partner cannot do or has trouble doing.</p>

    <p class="unit xs-1 s-1 m-1-2 l-1-2 gutter-1-2">Service Dogs accompany their partner wherever they go, including the workplace, shopping and traveling. These dogs provide a degree of independence that many people with a disability have never had before. Not having to depend on another person is a priceless gift.</p>

  <h1 class="unit xs-1 s-1 m-1 l-1">Children on the Autism Spectrum</h1>

  <img class="unit xs-1 s-1 m-1 l-1 pad-b image-2" src="images/child-with-dog.jpg" alt="Little girl with dog">

  <div class="grid">
    <p class="unit xs-1 s-1 m-1-2 l-1-2 gutter-1-2">Kids have a hard time fitting in and making friends, and social interaction for children with autism can be even more difficult. For many of these kids, a Social Dog can make all the difference. Dogs won't judge a child; they don’t care how popular a child is or how he or she forms sentences. The constant companionship and friendship of such a loving creature can help a child with autism build confidence.</p>

    <p class="unit xs-1 s-1 m-1-2 l-1-2 gutter-1-2">Social Dogs accompany their partner to doctor's appointments, restaurants, sporting events, and other public places. Many children who have a hard time coping with change find that having a constant companion can help them deal with transitions from place to place nd can add a bit of consistency to each day. In this respect, the dog serves as a focal point for the child. Parents are also able to help their children learn to read body language and learn empathy for others by using the dog as a model. Because our dogs are confident and happy to be in new situations, they are great examples for children.</p>

  <h1 class="unit xs-1 s-1 m-1 l-1">Dogs at your Desk</h1>

  <img class="unit xs-1 s-1 m-1 l-1 pad-b image-2" src="images/dog-scooter.jpg" alt="Lady with dog in the parking lot">

    <div class="grid">
    <p class="unit xs-1 s-1 m-1-2 l-1-2 gutter-1-2">In addition to providing Service Dogs directly for people with a disability, NEADS also trains Service Dogs for partnership with teachers, therapists and those who perform religious ministry. These canine assistants are matched with teachers or therapists that work with students who have mental or physical disabilities and ministers who seek to engage with their general community.</p>

    <p class="unit xs-1 s-1 m-1-2 l-1-2 gutter-1-2">Service Dogs for the classroom, therapy or ministry are owned by the individual handler, not by a school, business or religious institution. The primary handler is responsible for the care and costs associated with the dog, as well as the upkeep of the dog’s training. Service Dogs usually “work” during the day with their partner and then go home at night to be an “off-duty” family pet. There are so many things a Service Dog can do, and NEADS is happy to help teachers, therapists and ministers determine how to best utilize a Service Dog with their clients.</p>
