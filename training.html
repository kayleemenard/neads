<h1>Dog Training Methods</h1>

<img class="" src="images/graduation.jpg" alt="">

<p>NEADS Dogs are trained to perform tasks and behave obediently through the use of positive reinforcement and clear leadership. We select dogs that are natural followers, so it is easy to guide them into choosing behaviors that we like in order to reward them.</p>

<p>Our dogs love to work. The behaviors we teach are inherently fun for them (like tugging on a rope or running to a sound), so the dogs learn to associate work with having a good time. As a puppy grows and learns, each positive experience influences future behaviors.</p>

<p>During early training food is the primary reward that reinforces good behavior – this capitalizes on a common motivator for dogs. As time goes on, the food is reduced or replaced with other incentives so that the dog will work even when there is no food reward. Whether it’s a scratch on the chest or a chance to play ball, the dog knows that something good is coming! As a result, working is fun for both the dog and the human, which ensures a happy working relationship for many years to come.</p>

<p>NEADS Dogs are taught a list of core commands and they follow a basic training schedule throughout puppyhood. However, once a dog is nearing completion of the program and is matched with a specific client, the dog’s training is tailored to the client’s unique needs. After the client experiences 10-14 days of training with a skilled instructor, they can barely remember a time when the dog wasn’t a part of their life.</p>

<p>Our organization has trained Service Dog Teams for 39 years. Through research and experience, our instructors remain up to date with current training methods and trends in the industry. We routinely explore new dog breeds and new tasks to make certain that we are meeting the needs of our clients. Most importantly, we raise and train the perfect working partner for each of our clients.</p>

<h2>Assistance Dogs International Accreditation</h2>

<p>NEADS is proud to be an active member of Assistance Dogs International (ADI), the internationally recognized governing body that establishes industry standards and practices. ADI provides accreditation for canine assistance organizations that meet a selective set of criteria, including standards of excellence in the acquisition, training, and partnership of Assistance Dogs. NEADS clients are expected to maintain the minimum standards that ADI sets.</p>

<p>Visit the ADI website for more information on current standards of training for Service Dogs and their partners.</p>

<h1>Client Training</h1>

<img class="" src="images/woman-with-dog3.jpg" alt="">

<p>Clients live on our 18-acre campus for 5-10 days, training with their new Service Dog. Their training involves intensive learning about how to live and work with a Service Dog.</p>

<p>We schedule 2-5 clients to train at one time. Classes occur daily from 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. with an hour's lunch break. Classes include active, hands-on exercises with the dog, trips into town restaurants and malls, and sit-down classes in subjects such as health records, first aid, grooming and public access. Most classes are taught by the instructor who has overseen the dog's training and who matched the dog with the client. Other classes are taught by various staff members.</p>

<p>The dog begins to live at the client house with the client after three or four days of training. The client is now responsible for the dog's total care and exercise after class hours. If ten days of training is required, the client gets the weekend off from training. Some clients return home for this weekend, while others relax at NEADS.</p>

<p>Each client must successfully complete the training schedule and also receive a passing score on a public access test to graduate and leave campus with the Service Dog.</p>
