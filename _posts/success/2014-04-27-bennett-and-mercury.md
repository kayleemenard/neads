"NEADS has been a part of my life for about 12 years now, because Mercury is my second Service Dog. When I had my first Service Dog, I was living away at college. As time changed, my body got weaker. I knew when I needed a new dog I needed him to be able to get close to me, and cuddle me, because I can't cuddle him. Mercury's just been the most perfect match, and I couldn't thank people enough. Mercury makes my day - my days. There's not one day that he can't make me smile."
