"I was diagnosed at four and a half with a hearing loss, and it's been the past couple years that my hearing has fluctuated. There's some mornings I wake up and I can't hear anything. She's impacted my life tremendously. I can have a normal alarm clock now, and respond to people calling my name on campus. It's just amazing."
