"I work as a patient advocate at Boston Medical, and he delivers love and acceptance and caring to patients, family and staff. And many are patients who life has not been kind to, but Rylie doesn't care. His favorite patient is a terminally-ill patient who lost a sister to the same illness a year ago. Rylie and this young man have a special relationship, and he said to the specialist at work, "I know I'll be okay because Rylie will always be with me." And I can't say much more than that."
