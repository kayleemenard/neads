"The last six months has been a blessing. When I received Sasha I was trying to go back to work full time with a spinal cord injury, and Sasha has quickly adapted to life at UConn. She thinks she is a student. She enjoys picking up the numerous things I drop, opening doors, pushing buttons, and unwinding with the students at the end of the day. Overall she's given me the chance to live independently thousands of miles away from family."
