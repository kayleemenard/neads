"The medical community should spend 2 weeks at NEADS to see what is involved in healing people. Healing is more than apparatus. Healing is more than medicine. Healing comes when you have a companion that can do those things for you that you wish you could do but couldn't, and the emotional bond is so strong. I just wish that every medical professional could spend 2 weeks here [at NEADS] and see what happens to transform a life."
